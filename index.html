                <p class=" card-header small-text-white">I joined <a href="https://www.optigo.net/" target="blank_">Optigo Networks</a> as a Quality Assurance Engineer as my first technical job. In this time I designed and implemented an automated suite of API tests, conducted extensive hardware and software testing, and learned the ins and outs of the agile framework.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After a while I was moved to the developer team where I gained experience working on a distributed system in JavaScript, Python, MongoDB, and SQL.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Working in a hybrid Quality Assurance and Developer role has instilled the importance of rigorous testing, flexible design, and developing in a way that would make the QA version of myself proud.
